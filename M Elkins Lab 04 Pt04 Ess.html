    <!-- The concept of the following code was taken from Eloquent Java p 242 and my Lab 04 Pt03 Ess exercise; I have added all the comments; I have deleted a bunch of code that isn't necessary for this example and I have added code where noted New in the comments -->

    <!-- New instruction line -->
    <p>Click and drag your mouse to move a circle across the screen.</p>

    <!-- my canvas from Ess Pt03 -->
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="400" style = "border: 2px solid #000000;"></canvas>

    <script>

        // this block is from my original circle from Ess Pt03
        var canv = document.getElementById("myCanvas");  // working with yellow bordered canvas
        var contxt = canv.getContext("2d");  // in 2d
        contxt.strokeStyle = "#f40085";  // purple

        addEventListener("mousemove", moved);  // add an event listener to the whole screen so that when the mouse moves call moved method

        function moved (event) {

            // draw a circle where the mouse is
            contxt.beginPath();
            contxt.arc(event.pageX, event.pageY, 15, 0, 2*Math.PI);
            contxt.stroke();
        }
